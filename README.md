# Fractal_modelling

Code for generating a fractal point set characterized by the correlation dimension D₂.

Fractal_modelling.cpp - main C++ file for the modeling.

draw1D.py, draw2D.py, draw3D.py - visualization in 1D, 2d and 3D cases.

Fractal_analysis.py - estimation of correletion fractal dimension D₂.
